Hey you did it!  

You now know the basics of using HTML & CSS to build webpages.

Congratulations!

But we have of course only just touched the surface today.  There is so much more you can learn about just HTML and CSS.

So what to do now?

1. You can build your own HTML pages about whatever you want.
2. Upload your pages to a free hosting service like https://neocities.org/ and show them off to your family and friends.
3. Learn more about HTML & CSS at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

Or if you are feeling confident you can move straight onto the the Introduction to Javascript workshop and learn how to make your pages more interactive.
