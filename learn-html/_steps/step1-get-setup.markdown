## What we're building

So we are going to learn HTML & CSS by creating a simple website.  Just a few pages.

What we are going to do is create a simple recipes site.


## What you need

The best thing about making web pages is that you don't really need very much to get started.

1. A Text Editor.
2. A Web Browser.

## Text Editors, source code & plain text

about plain text as the simplest format for text (hence plain)

features for programming: syntax highlighting, file views, completion suggestion, snippets

## Setup

Create a folder somewhere on your computer that makes sense for you.  Everything we create in this workshop will be created in that folder.  It could be on your desktop, or your documents folder, or wherever.

Now create these three files:

1. `index.html`
2. `traditional-cupcakes.html`
3. `muffins.html`

## Our content

`index.html`
